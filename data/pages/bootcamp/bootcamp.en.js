  text34: `Do you want to come to Málaga to just follow the language classes and learn Spanish like no other? Or do you already want to master some Spanish before starting the bootcamp? Than you are in the right place.`,
  text35: `You could already take Spanish lessons in your home country or download an application like Duolingo. We always recommend to take lessons in the country itself. You learn twice as fast, because you immediately have to practice it outside the language school.`,
  text36: `If you want to brush up on your English instead of your Spanish? That is also possible.`,
  text37: `We offer these lessons through various partners. Of course you can follow lessons on your own, with acquaintances or with others. By following language lessons you will make friends easily and feel at home quickly.`,
  text38: `That is reassuring, right?`,
